    "# **Marks: 40**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the project on Recommendation Systems. We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## **Context:**\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business. \n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "## **Objective:**\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "## **Dataset:** \n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n",
    "- **timestamp:** Time of the rating. We **will not use this column** to solve the current problem"

Its relative frequency exceeds 0.5, which implies that more than half of the ratings in the dataset are 5.0. There is a positive skew in the data, meaning there is a higher concentration of higher ratings. Counts have been normalized to show proportions rather than absolute counts by the command value_counts(1). Ratings 3 to 1 are the least occuring, suggesting that people give ratings for products they really like."

    "Observation: An RMSE of 1.0012 suggests that the average prediction error is slightly over 20% of the full range of possible ratings (5 - 0 = 5). The RMSE value suggests that on average, the predicted ratings are about 1 point away from the actual ratings. Precision of 0.855 suggests that 85.5% of the items the system recommends are actually liked by the users. Out of all the recommended products 85.5% are relevant. The recall of 0.858 indicates that the system successfully retrieves a high proportion of the items that users are interested in. Out of all the relevant products, 85.8% are recommended. The F_1 score which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is 0.856. This suggests a system with both high precision and high recall. An F_1 score closer to 1 is indicative of a robust model. The model recommends items to a user based on the preferences of similar users. Cosine similarity is useful when you're more interested in the orientation (i.e., which items users like, regardless of the number of items rated) rather than the magnitude of ratings. Random_state=1 ensures that the results are reproducible."

    "To demonstrate \"user-user-similarity-based collaborative filtering\",\"item-item-similarity-based collaborative filtering\", and \"model-based (matrix factorization) collaborative filtering\", surprise library has been introduced. For these algorithms grid search cross-validation is applied to find the best working model, and using that the corresponding predictions are done.\n",
