# Quick Start Guide for Recruiters & Reviewers

This guide helps you quickly navigate and understand this portfolio repository.

## üéØ What This Repository Contains

This repository showcases **3 complete data science projects** from the MIT IDSS program, demonstrating end-to-end machine learning pipelines with real-world applications.

## üìÅ How to Navigate

### Option 1: Quick View (Recommended for First Look)
1. **Open the main README.md** - See project overview and highlights
2. **Click any `.html` file** in project folders - View complete analysis in your browser
   - No installation needed
   - All code, outputs, and visualizations are visible
   - Works immediately

### Option 2: Run Notebooks Locally
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run the automated setup script:**
   - Windows: `setup_venv.bat` (or `.\setup_venv.ps1` in PowerShell)
   - This creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies automatically
3. **Register Jupyter kernel** (one-time, after setup):
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=mit-idss-projects --display-name "Python (MIT-IDSS)"
   ```
4. **Open `.ipynb` files** in Cursor, VS Code, or Jupyter
5. **Select the kernel** (top-right of notebook) ‚Üí Choose `Python (MIT-IDSS)`
6. **Run cells** to see the analysis in action

## üìñ Reading the Projects

1. **Start with README.md** in each project folder - Understand the problem and approach
2. **Review the notebook** - See the complete analysis
3. **Check data/README.md** - Understand the dataset used

## üöÄ Running Notebooks Locally (Detailed Steps)

### After Running setup_venv.bat:

**Step 1: Register Jupyter Kernel** (one-time only)
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=mit-idss-projects --display-name "Python (MIT-IDSS)"
```

**Step 2: Open and Run Notebooks**

#### Method A: In Cursor/VS Code (Recommended)
1. Open any `.ipynb` notebook file
2. Click "Select Kernel" (top-right corner)
3. Choose: `Python (MIT-IDSS)` or browse to `.\venv\Scripts\python.exe`
4. Run cells with Shift+Enter (run from top to bottom)

#### Method B: Standalone Jupyter
```bash
# Activate venv first
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

**Daily Workflow:**
- **In Cursor/VS Code:** Just open the notebook - no activation needed if kernel is selected
- **In Terminal:** Activate venv first: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

### Troubleshooting

**"Module not found" error?**
‚Üí Make sure you selected the venv kernel (check top-right of notebook)

**Kernel not showing?**
‚Üí Run the kernel registration command again (Step 1 above)

**Can't activate venv?**
‚Üí Make sure you're in the project root folder where `venv` exists

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I view results without running code?**  
A: Yes! Open any `.html` file in your browser to see all outputs and visualizations.

**Q: Are datasets included?**  
A: Yes, datasets are in the `data/` folder of each project.

**Q: What Python version is required?**  
A: Python 3.8 or higher. See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies.

**Q: Do I need special software?**  
A: For viewing: Just a web browser (for HTML files). For running: Cursor, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.

**Q: How do I set up everything?**  
A: Just run `setup_venv.bat` - it handles everything automatically! See the main README.md for full instructions.
