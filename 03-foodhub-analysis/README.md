# FoodHub Order Analysis & Delivery Time Prediction

## Overview
An end-to-end data analytics project analyzing food delivery operations, predicting delivery times, and understanding customer behavior patterns to optimize restaurant performance and customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Analyze food delivery order data to understand restaurant demand patterns, predict delivery times accurately, and identify factors influencing customer ratings. This helps optimize operations, improve customer experience, and increase business efficiency.

## Solution Approach

### Analytics & Modeling
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Comprehensive statistical analysis and pattern identification
2. **Regression Modeling** - Predictive models for delivery time estimation
3. **Time Series Analysis** - Understanding temporal patterns in orders
4. **Customer Behavior Analysis** - Identifying factors affecting ratings

### Key Analyses
- **Temporal Patterns:** Order distribution by day of week, time of day
- **Cuisine Analysis:** Demand patterns across different cuisine types
- **Cost Segments:** Order behavior across price ranges
- **Delivery Time Prediction:** Regression models for preparation and delivery times
- **Rating Analysis:** Factors influencing customer satisfaction scores

## Key Metrics & Evaluation

### Regression Metrics
- **R² Score** - Coefficient of determination (model fit)
- **RMSE** - Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE** - Mean Absolute Error

### Analytical Insights
- Identified peak demand periods and high-performing cuisines
- Established correlations between order characteristics and delivery times
- Discovered patterns in customer rating behavior

## Skills Demonstrated
- Regression Analysis (Linear, Polynomial)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Modeling
- Data Visualization
- Feature Engineering from Temporal & Categorical Variables
- Business Intelligence & Operational Insights
