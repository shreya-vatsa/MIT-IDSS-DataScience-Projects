# MIT-IDSS-DataScience-Projects

A collection of data science and machine learning projects completed during the **MIT IDSS – Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions** program (Jan–Apr 2024), in collaboration with Great Learning.

These projects showcase practical applications of data science techniques using real-world case studies across e-commerce, EdTech, and online food delivery platforms. Each notebook reflects a full data science pipeline — from data cleaning and EDA to modeling, evaluation, and insights.
